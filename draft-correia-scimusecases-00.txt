1.  Introduction

   This document provides the SCIM definitions, overview, concepts,
   flows, scenarios, and use cases.  It also provides a list of the
   requirements derived from the use cases.  The document's objective is
   to help with understanding of the design and applicability of the
   SCIM schema [RFC7643] and SCIM protocol [RFC7644].
   Unlike the practice of some protocols like Application Bridging for

   Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) and SAML2 WebSSO, SCIM provides
   provisioning and de-provisioning of resources in a separate context
   from authentication (aka just-in-time provisioning).
   This document will describe the different construct that we have in
   the SCIM protocol and will provide the most typical use case that we
   will find in the implementation, will also help identify the
   interactions between the different constructs and guide on the roles
   that each has in the SCIM protocol.
   SCIM is a protocol where it relies on one-to-one interaction, in a
   client-server model.  Any interaction is based on a trigger that will
   start a CRUD event on one or many resources.

3.  SCIM Components and Architecture

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
   is designed to manage resources and services in applications using
   standards to enable better interoperability, security, and
   scalability.

   The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing
   schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of
   development and integration, while applying existing authentication,
   authorization, and privacy models.
   The intent of the SCIM specification is to reduce the cost and
   complexity of user management operations by providing a common user
   schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide
   patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols.  In
   essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move resources in to, out
   of, and around the applications.
   The SCIM scenarios are overviews of user stories designed to help
   clarify the intended scope of the SCIM effort.

3.1.  Implementation Concepts

   There are two roles that any implementer in a SCIM interaction must
   play: an HTTP Client-Server role, and a Data Flow role.

3.1.1.  HTTP Client-Server Roles

   HTTP client and server roles are defined in [RFC 7230] - any SCIM
   interaction requires each participant to play a complementary role.

3.1.1.1.  SCIM Server (also known as a SCIM Service Provider)

   An HTTP web application that provides identity information via the
   SCIM protocol.
   A SCIM Server is a RESTful API endpoint offering access to a data
   model that can be used to push or pull data between two parties.
   SCIM servers have additional responsibilities such as API Security,
   managing client identifiers & keys as well as performance management
   such as API throttling.

Internet-Draft  System for Cross-domain Identity Managem       July 2023


3.1.1.2.  SCIM Client

   A website or application that uses the SCIM protocol to manage
   identity data maintained by the service provider.  The client
   initiates SCIM HTTP requests to a target service provider.
   A SCIM Client is active software that can call one or more SCIM
   servers in order to push or pull data between two parties.

3.1.2.  Data Flow Roles/Constructs

   Constructs are the operating parties that take part in both sides of
   a SCIM protocol exchange and have specific functions in the protocol.
   A specific element can have one or more constructs roles, depending
   on the type of services that is delivering in the SCIM architecture.
   So far, we have identified the following SCIM constructs:

   Resource Object (RO): Is and object that is going to be manipulated
   (CRUD) by the different SCIM players, and in the end the ultimate
   goal to be pass across different systems and to make sure that
   consistent information is exchange.  The Resource Object have
   attributes that are define by Schemas, an example of that is the SCIM
   Core Schema defines in [RFC 7643].

   Resource Attributes (RA): Is one element of the Resource Object (RO),
   it can have a single value or contain multiple values to describe a
   specific resource and its characteristics, an example of this can be
   the different attributes for user and/or groups under the SCIM Core
   Schema defined in [RFC 7643].

   Resource Creator (RC): Is an entity operating in a given service, is
   responsible of creating the Resource Object (RO) with is Resource
   Attributes (RA), typically we can see this role in HR or resource
   management applications that are responsible to create resources and
   be authorities for some or all its attributes.

   Resource Updater (RU): Is an entity that is responsible for update
   specific attributes (RA) of a Resource Object (RO).  Typically, this
   role is use in conjunction with other SCIM roles that allow this SCIM
   entity to be authority for a specific Resource Attribute (RA).

   Resource Manager (RM): Is an entity that consolidated the resource
   Objects (RO) from the Resource Creators/Updaters (RC/RU) and make it
   available for the Resource Subscribers (RS), typically this entity/
   role is handle by the IDaaS.

   Resource Subscriber (RS): Is an entity that consumes Resource Objects
   (RO) but that is not authoritative to create them or any of its
   Resource Attribute (RA), normally this entity is only interested in

   part of the Resource Objects available in the Resource Manager (RM),
   typically it is an application that requires information on resources
   that it operate.

   External Resource Creator (ERC): Is an entity that has information
   about resources and its attributes, but that doesn’t understand SCIM,
   typically it is going to provide the information on the resources to
   the Resources Manager, using non SCIM protocols/mechanisms, an
   example of this would be a services that gets information about users
   from an LDAP server and provide it to an IDaaS using some kind of
   proprietary REST APIs.

3.1.2.1.  Mechanics behind Resource Object (RO) and/or Resource
          Attributes (RA)

   Cover in the previous section it was stated that the RC/RU were
   authoritative over the RO/RA, that could be achieved using the
   mutability, concept introduced in [RFC 7644], where they would have
   readWrite/readOnly capabilities over them and this information would
   be pass to the RM.
   In more complex scenarios where the SCIM element doesn't has direct
   contact with the RC/RU that create/update a specific RO/RA, then the
   RM that received the original information will have the ReadWrite
   capabilities in the mutability field. this can be pass from RM to RM,
   with this mechanism we can prevent loops.
   When different components exist that have bi-direction connection,
   where they can update each other in different RA (Resource
   Attributes), there can only be on readWrite for a specific RA, so
   that we don't enter loops.

3.1.3.  Triggers

   Triggers are actions or activities that may cause a SCIM interaction
   to occur.  Triggers can occur as a result of business processes like
   a corporate hiring event, can be scheduled events such as a unix bash
   script running as a chron job, or can be just-in-time events such as
   SAML assertion arriving at a federated relying party that identifies
   a not-seen-before user.  Triggers can also be standardized events,
   such as those in the OpenID Shared Signals Framework.  Triggers used
   to allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SCIM Actions or
   Operations as it is designed to capture a class of use case that
   makes sense to the actor requesting it rather than to describe a
   protocol operation.

3.1.3.1.  Periodic Interval Triggers

   SCIM client will execute SCIM actions configured at specific interval
   of time, the interval of time are configured by the client.  It can
   use any of the SCIM actions defined in the next sections.

3.1.3.2.  Event Triggers

   Events triggers can take many formats, for example we could have an
   SaaS application that send an email to request an SCIM action.
   Another example in the device space, the trigger can be an message
   from a mobile device to request an SCIM action from the Client to the
   device that will be the Server.  In fact triggers can be anything and
   is not going to be exhausted numerated in this use case document.
   Event Trigger by nature are asynchronous, and start an SCIM action
   unlike other triggers that have synchronous behaviors.  A recommended

Internet-Draft  System for Cross-domain Identity Managem       July 2023


   implementation of event trigger is using Security Events for SCIM
   service providers and receivers as specified by the Security Event
   Tokens (SET) [RFC8417] to create triggers for SCIM actions, details
   for SCIM profile for Security Event Tokens are available in [draft-
   ietf-scim-events].
   In this specification SCIM Clients may need to be informed of changes
   that occur over time.  This could be achieved through the use of
   event messages or signals in the form of Security Event Tokens (SET).
   SET tokens convey information about changes that have occurred in a
   publishing domain that may be of interest to a receiving domain.
   Unlike SCIM Protocol requests, Security Events do not describe
   actions that a receiver must take, rather they are simple statements
   of fact about changes that have already occurred.  The intent, is to
   allow the event receiver to determine the best follow-up action to
   take within the context of the receiving domain.

3.1.3.3.  Application Triggers

   Applications triggers are very specific of the different applications
   that implement SCIM protocol and can be initiated by the
   administration interfaces or by the end-user interface.
   Typically they can be done in the administration consoles of the RM
   (Resource Managers), RC (Resource Creators) or RU (Resource Updaters)
   when there is a need for a fast update that can't wait for the next
   schedule cycle.
   It is also possible in some use case where the clients of the
   applications that implement SCIM can generate an update because RA
   (Resource Attributes) of a Specific RO (Resource Object) changed,
   this is a typical example of an device that have some attribute
   changed and where the device managed applications orders the client
   to do an update just for that specific device.

3.1.3.4.  SSO (Single Sign-On) Triggers

   This model of the trigger is created for those scenarios where a
   Single Sign-On flow happens, but for some reason is not able to bring
   all the RA (Resource Attributes) of a specific RO (Resource Object),
   so the IdM (Identity Manager) will implement an HTTP Patch to deliver
   an update to the RO (Resource Object) with the additional RA
   (Resource Attributes).

   1.  SSO trigger that creates the user and might create a couple of
       most well know RA ( Resource Attributes) of a RO (Resource
       Objects)

   2.  SCIM actions that will complement the attributes created before
       with an SSO JIT with additional RA (Resource Attributes) of the
       RO (Resource Objects) created before.
       This use case combines the SCIM protocol with other protocols
       used for Single Sign-On, specially in the use case of JIT (Just
       in time Provision), addressing the limitation of JIT.

3.1.4.  SCIM Actions

   The SCIM protocol defines interactions between two standardized
   parties that conform to HTTP RESTful conventions.  The protocol
   enables CRUD operations by corresponding those activities to HTTP
   verbs such as POST, PUT, GET, DELETE etc.  The protocol itself
   doesn't assume a direction of data flow, and use cases discussed in
   section 3 can be accomplished by entities in either protocol role.

3.1.4.1.  Client active Push

   Client will use HTTP PUSH to create a RO and will use HTTP PATCH/PUT
   to update its RA.  In this section we will cover the basic constructs
   and will not detail the most complex use case describe before, since
   they would be just adding new elements to basic constructs describe
   bellow.

3.1.4.1.1.  Resource Object creation from Client to Server

   In this model we will have a Client that is going to provide

   1.  Before creating an RO or update it or its RA the SCIM client will
       always do an HTTP GET to get an update from the SCIM Service
       Provider.

   2.  Service Provider will provide it RO and RA for that resource
       asked by the SCIM Client.

   3.  Based on the RO and RA returned by the SP (Service Provider),
       there will be a HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH depending on the operation
       that the Client want to achieve.

   4.  The Service Provider will return the RO and its RA with
       additional metadata information to allow for audit.
       In the use cases that we saw before,it is related to section 3.1,
       where the SCIM client will map to the RM/RC/RU and the Server
       will map into RS.

   The center component as describe is the Server for the client on the

   Typically the Server on the right is an application that wan tto
   consume RO and its RA.
   In addition to the models before now the "HR Application also
   subscribe to RA that are created by the RS and reported by the RM,
   the Application will be the creator of specific attributes.

3.1.4.2.  Client Active Pull

   This model of the trigger is created for those scenarios where there
   is no status database in the client, and where the Clients choose
   when and how often to make HTTP GET calls to the server, based on the
   size of the object population the client is tracking, the frequency
   of the data change, and the use case, for example the synchronization
   of a registry of objects vs. point updates when an event takes
   place.These factors may result in clients periodically polling a
   large set of SCIM Server objects to check for changes.
   Examples of cases where the client active pull is used include
   situations where a client needs to maintain a synchronized large body
   of objects, such as a device list or user address book.  Another use
   case would be a client that needs to have details of a specific
   device that was onboard for example by a mobile application.

3.1.4.2.1.  Resource Object Creation or Update

   In this model we will have a Client that is going to pull information
   about a RO and its RA from a Server, can also be called as Service
   Provider in [RFC 7643] and [RFC 7644].  In this model the Client is
   going to management all the RO (Resource Objects) and its RA
   (Resource Attributes), that are provided by the Server, and the RM
   (Resource Management) function resides on the Client.

   1.  The SCIM client will do an HTTP GET to obtain the details of the
       device its attributes, the RO and its RA.

   2.  The SCIM Service Provider will return the RO and its RA with
       additional metadata information to allow for audit.
       A typical example of this use case is a device that is going to
       use a mobile or browser base enrollment and gathers its
       attributes, after that process that is outside the scope of the
       SCIM protocol, the Device (or Server on their behalf) is ready
       for the IDM platform to get its details and do all the management
       roles necessary for all the domain devices.

   In this model we will have the Client that is going to pull
   information about a RO and its RA from the Server, can also be called
   as Service Provider in [RFC 7643] and [RFC 7644].  In this model in
   the Client there is no status database in the client, and it gets a
   list of all the RO (Resource Objects) or a subset of it based on
   filters, so there will be a full update every synchronization cycle.

3.1.4.2.3.  Resource Object Creation or Update and Subscription

   In this model we will bring together 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 where a
   typically a device can up be the creator or their own attributes and
   will allow an SaaS service to subscribe to all the different RO
   (Resource Objects) and deliver additional services for other devices.
   It isn't expected from any of the SCIM clients in the Active pull
   model to create any status database of attributes changes, so the
   clients will always do GET on one or many RO ( Resource Objects)
   periodically.

   1.  The SCIM client will do an HTTP GET to obtain the RO (Resource
       Object) and its RA (Resource Attributes) of the device.

   2.  SCIM Service Provider (Device) will return the RO and its RA with
       additional metadata information to allow for audit.

   3.  SCIM client will do an HTTP GET to obtain the selected list of RO
       (Resource Object) and its RA (Resource Attributes).

   4.  SCIM Service Provider will return the RO and its RA with
       additional metadata information to allow for audit.

   A good example would be a device that is going to use a mobile or
   browser base enrollment to gather its attributes, after that process
   which is outside the scope of the SCIM protocol, the Device (or
   Server on their behalf) is ready for the IDM platform to get its
   details and do all the management roles necessary for all the domain
   devices.
   Also in the use case is the SaaS service that needs to consume a list
   of contacts or devices, this SaaS service will need to know the
   relevant Ro (Resource Objects) and its RA ( Resource Attributes),
   this operation will happen periodically and every time will get a
   full list of all the RO (Resource Objects).

4.  SCIM Use Cases

   This section we will describe the most common SCIM use cases, and
   will explain when, where, why and how we find them in the cross
   domain environment for resources managing.  This list by no way tries
   to be exhaustive and complete, its ultimate goal is to guide
   developers for the possibility of such models and will try to explain
   their challenges and components.  As mention before SCIM is a
   protocol for cross domains where two entities exchange information
   about a resource, with the use cases we try to go further and explain
   on how the different components can interact to allow from simple to
   complex architectures for cross domain resource management.
   Typically each use case add something on top of the previous one,
   starting in the most simple one, and finishing in the most complex
   ones, to make it easier the explanation, assume that what was
   describe in the previous use case applies to the use cases that come
   after.

4.1.  CRUD operation on a single resource, associated to the AuthZ
      action.

   Get information about persona.
   A use case cover in [RFC7644] where a SCIM client can do CRUD
   operation on the entity of the user, in this use case the SCIM client
   that is the RM (Resource Manager), RC (Resource Creator) and RU
   (Resource Updater), will be able to read, create, update the RO
   (Resource Object) and its RA ( Resource Attributes) in the RS
   (Resource Subscriber). the RS will provide an /me URI to achieve
   this.
   Special consideration needs to happen from authorization perspective,
   unlike the other CRUD operation describe in this document the
   authorization for this use case only allows access to the RO
   (Resource Object) of the user that authenticate.

4.2.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications

   Single RM/RC/RU and multiple RS.
   This is very common and simple SCIM use case, we have the IdM/Device
   Managers/etc. do all CRUD operation with the resources, then using
   the trigger mechanisms the resource information reach the Resource
   Subscribers, also know as the SaaS Application.
   The RS (Resource Subscriber) will take the decision on which RA
   (Resource Attributes) to consider and how the Resource Object will
   show in their resource database.
   Typically we can find this kind of use case in small to mid size
   organization, where there is no structure method to handle the
   resources and typically in Organization that start with a blank sheet
   of paper or it is a greenfield Organization.

4.3.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and Objects coming
      from external non SCIM source.

   One or more ERC with single RM/RC/RU and multiple RS.
   This is the most common use case, because it allow the organization
   to adopt SCIM protocol for CRUD operations of their resources.  In
   this use case the organization already have an existent database of
   resources that is going to be the source of truth for the Resource
   Manager.  At no point in time the SCIM RM will provide SCIM operation
   with that External Resource Creator.
   Normally this ERC, specially if we are talking about user Identity,
   will have a User database that can be accessible using LDAP or can
   provide information of their user attributes by doing an SAML Single
   Sign-On using Just in time Provision.  Most of the IDaaS also provide
   softwares that allow them to get resource information by using
   proprietary protocols.  It is common to see HTTP REST to get the
   information from the ERC to the RM.
   Typically in this use case the RM will become the new source of truth
   for the resources of our Organization, will add extra Resource
   Attributes and ignore other RA that existed in the ERC.
   Some organization that already realize that going forward the RM will
   be the authority answer for the Resources Object and Attributes, will
   start create new Resource Objects in this service.
   The Resource Subscribers will consume all the resource information
   from the RM.
   Typically we will see this use case in small to mid size organization
   where resources were organized in a non standard and non open
   platform for Resources Management, where it isn't possible to cut/
   replace everything with a new system.

4.4.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and Objects coming
      from external SCIM source.

   One or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS.
   In this use case, the the CRUD operation for the RO (Resource Object)
   and its RA (Resource Attributes) does not belong to the RM (Resource
   Manager), this is done in a separate SCIM entity, the Resource
   Creator/Resource Updater.
   A good example of this is use case on Users where Organization have
   their HR application, and the lifecycle of the resource (typically
   groups and Users) is done by that application.
   We could also have this use case where the RM is extended with the
   Roles of RC/RU for extra RA (Resources Attributes) that are not
   authoritative by the "HR System", but normally that bring more
   complexity to the authority models for the CRUD operation of the
   resources.
   Typically we will see this use case in mid to large organization
   where no structure method to handle the resources and they start
   fresh or it is a greenfield.

4.5.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and Objects coming
      from external SCIM and non SCIM source including the IDM itself,
      where some object attributes come from SaaS application.

   One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and
   multiple RS.
   In this use case, the Resource information is in a ERC (External
   Resource Creator), and the entity that has the role of RC/RU (example
   given before the HR System) consumes information from the ERC.  To
   avoid delays or loops the RM will also get original information from
   the ERC, just like the RC/RU.  The RC/RU, either in the ERC or in the
   "HR application" can add extra Resource Attributes, so from a model
   perspective, the RM get its authoritative Information from both
   systems the RC/RU and from the ERC.
   In this model there need to be careful thoughts so that we avoid
   loops where specific Resource Attributes write over and over again by
   the ERC and RC/RU.
   Typically we will see this use case in mid to large organization
   where resources were organized in a non standard, non open platform
   for Resources Management and it isn't possible to cut/replace
   everything with a new system.

4.6.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and Objects coming
      from external SCIM and non SCIM source including the IDM itself,
      where some object attributes come from SaaS application.

   One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and
   multiple RS/RU.
   In this use case we add the capability of the Resource Subscriber to
   be also an Resource Update, it is very common that an SaaS
   application can be authoritative for specific RA and add extra
   details to the RO.
   Typically we will see this use case in large organization where
   resources were organized in a non standard, non open platform for
   Resources Management and it isn't possible to cut/replace everything
   with a new system.  Those organization start to adopt many
   application that brings attributes to the different resources that
   already exist in the system.

4.7.  IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and Objects coming
      from external SCIM and non SCIM sources including the IdM itself,
      where some object attributes come from SaaS application, and are
      updated in the SCIM object creator.

   One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU/RS, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and
   multiple RS/RU.
   In this use case we introduce the possibility of the RC/RU (example
   given before the HR System) be interested in the attribute that was
   created updated by the RS/RU (also known as the SaaS application), an
   example could be adding the business email that was created by the
   mail service (that came from RS/RU) to the HR information service
   (the RC/RU/RS element).
   Typically we will see this use case in large organization where
   resources were organized in a non standard, non open platform for
   Resources Management and it isn't possible to cut/replace everything
   with a new system.  Those organization start to adopt many
   application that brings attributes to the different resources that
   already exist in the system, but they need to have all the important
   attributes of Resources in a application in our examples "HR
   application".

4.8.  Multiple IdM doing CRUD operations on SaaS applications, and
      Objects coming from external SCIM and non SCIM sources including
      the IdM itself, where some object attributes come from SaaS
      application, and are updated in the SCIM object creator.

   One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU/RS, with one or more RM/RC/RU/RS
   and multiple RS/RU.
   In this use case we introduce the possibility of having multiple
   Resource Managers, where the information from the RO/RA is
   consolidated across different domains/services.
   As in the previous 3 uses cases we need to have careful thoughts so
   that we avoid loops where specific Resource Attributes write over and
   over again by the ERC and RC/RU, having now extra consideration for
   the fact that now we can have multiple Resource Managers.
   Typically we will see this use case in large organization, or between
   organization that have their own business to business communication
   and have the need for exchange information about Resources.  Many
   other good example can be provided like organizations that by merging
   or acquisition, arrive to a situation where multiple RM exist, and
   their IT departments have to merge Resource information.

5.  Security Considerations

   Authentication and authorization must be guaranteed for the SCIM
   operations to ensure that only authenticated entities can perform the
   SCIM requests and the requested SCIM operations are authorized.  SCIM
   resources (e.g., Users and Groups) can contain sensitive information.
   Thus, data confidentiality MUST be guaranteed at the transport layer.
   There can be privacy issues that go beyond transport security, e.g.,
   moving personally identifying information (PII) offshore between
   different SCIM elements.  Regulatory requirements shall be met when
   migrating identity information between jurisdictional regions (e.g.,
   countries and states may have differing regulations on privacy).
   Additionally, privacy-sensitive data elements may be omitted or
   obscured in SCIM transactions or stored records to protect these data
   elements for a user.  For instance, a role-based identifier might be
   used in place of an individual's name.  Detailed security
   considerations are specified in Section 7 of the SCIM protocol
   [RFC7644] and Section 9 of the SCIM schema [RFC7643].
