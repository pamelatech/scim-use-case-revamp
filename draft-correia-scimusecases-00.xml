<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) family of specifications <xref target="RFC7643"></xref> and <xref target="RFC7644"></xref> is designed to manage resources used in the practice of identity management that need to be communicated across internet domains and services, with users and groups as the default resources supported (and an extensibility model additional resource definition). The specifications have two primary goals: 1) A common representation of a resource object and its attributes, and 2) Standardized patterns for how those resources can be operated on, including "CRUD" operations that create, read, update or delete resource objects and more advanced goals such as search filters, synchronization of large resource populations, etc. These goals are codified as a data model in <xref target="RFC7643"></xref> defining resources, attributes and default schema, as well as a protocol definition built on HTTP in <xref target="RFC7644"></xref>. By standardizing the data model and protocol for resource management, entire ecosystems can achieve better interoperability, security, and scalability.</t>

<t>This document provides definitions, overview, concepts, flows, and use cases implementers may need to understand the design and applicability of the SCIM schema <xref target="RFC7643"></xref> and SCIM protocol <xref target="RFC7644"></xref>. Unlike the practice of some protocols like Application Bridging for Federated Access Beyond web (ABFAB) and SAML2 WebSSO, SCIM provides provisioning and de-provisioning of resources in a separate context from authentication. While SCIM is a protocol that standardizes movement of data only between two parties in a HTTP client-server model, implementation patterns are discussed in this document that use concepts beyond the core schema and protocol, but that are needed to understand how SCIM actions can fit into greater architectures.</t>

<section anchor="scim-components-and-architecture"><name>SCIM Components and Architecture</name>
<t>SCIM architecture is a client-server model centered on a normative concept of a "resource". Resources have types (such as a user or a group) and each unique instance of a resource type is represented by a JSON object, actively accessed via a standardized REST API.  Each resource object can be managed individually or managed in bulk using actions that by default are specified in <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> (HTTP GET, PUT, POST etc), but that may expand to concepts in extension documents, for example security event tokens (SETs). This model therefore enables organizations to represent information about user populations and the groups that these user populations are part of using the core specifications and to extend to other important resources using extension drafts in the same family with the high level concepts of performing SCIM actions on resource objects. SCIM actions result in resource object and associated data "moving" between the client and server, as clients actively push and pull information that reflects change over time. This communication of data enables systems within domains and across domains to operate on the freshest possible version of object state.</t>

<t>The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.<br />
The intent of the SCIM specification is to reduce the cost and complexity of resource management operations by providing a common schemas and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move resources in to, out of, and around the applications.<br />
The SCIM scenarios are overviews of user stories designed to help clarify the intended scope of the SCIM effort.</t>

<section anchor="implementation-concepts"><name>Implementation Concepts</name>
<t>To understand the use cases we need to understand 4 different concepts of the protocol, that will describe underlying protocol, the different orchestrators roles, how we start the SCIM interaction and what methods we have to execute the actions.</t>

<section anchor="data-model"><name>Data Model</name>
<t>SCIM defines two types of data entities: resources and attributes.</t>

<section anchor="resource-object-ro"><name>Resource Object (RO)</name>
<t>A JSON object representing a user, group (or extension object) to be manipulated through the SCIM protocol. The Resource Object contains attributes defined by schemas such as those defined in <xref target="RFC7643"></xref> and can be acted on via the endpoints and parameters defined in <xref target="RFC7644"></xref>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-attribute-ra"><name>Resource Attribute (RA)</name>
<t>A named element of a Resource Object. Attributes are defined in section 2 of <xref target="RFC7643"></xref> and include characteristics like cardinality (single or multiple values), data types (string, boolean, binary etc) and characteristics (required, unique etc).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="http-client-server-roles"><name>HTTP Client-Server Roles</name>
<t>HTTP client and server roles are defined in <xref target="RFC9110"></xref> and <xref target="RFC9112"></xref>. Any SCIM interaction requires one participant to be a SCIM server and the other to be a SCIM client.</t>

<section anchor="scim-server-also-known-as-a-scim-service-provider"><name>SCIM Server (also known as a SCIM Service Provider)</name>
<t>An HTTP web application that provides identity information via the SCIM protocol.<br />
A SCIM Server is a RESTful API endpoint offering access to a data model that can be used to push or pull data between two parties. SCIM servers have additional responsibilities such as API Security, managing client identifiers &amp; keys as well as performance management such as API throttling.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="scim-client"><name>SCIM Client</name>
<t>A website or application that uses the SCIM protocol to manage identity data maintained by the service provider.  The client initiates SCIM HTTP requests to a target SCIM Server. A SCIM Client is active software that can push or pull data between two parties.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="orchestrator-roles"><name>Orchestrator Roles</name>
<t>Orchestrators are the operating parties that take part in a SCIM protocol exchange and ensure data is moving in the correct flows.
An entity can have one or more orchestrators roles, depending on the overall provisioning architecture.</t>

<section anchor="resource-creator-rc"><name>Resource Creator (RC)</name>
<t>An entity responsible for creating the Resource Object (RO). Typically we can see this role in HR or resource management applications that are responsible for creating resources and some of its attributes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-updater-ru"><name>Resource Updater (RU)</name>
<t>An entity responsible for updating specific attributes of a Resource Object (RO) or the RO itself. Typically, this role is used in conjunction with other SCIM roles that allow this SCIM entity to manage a specific Resource Attribute (RA).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-manager-rm"><name>Resource Manager (RM)</name>
<t>An entity that aggregates or transforms resource objects from resource creators/updaters (RC/RU) and make them available for resource subscribers (RS) using multiple SCIM interactions, an example of this role could be an Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) cloud platform.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-subscriber-rs"><name>Resource Subscriber (RS)</name>
<t>An entity that consumes information in resource objects (RO) and typically don't create new objects or attributes. An example of entities that play this role include SaaS applications relying on an IDaaS cloud platform.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="external-resource-creator-erc"><name>External Resource Creator (ERC)</name>
<t>An entity that has information about resources and its attributes, but does not participate in SCIM flows, examples include databases or internally-facing applications.</t>

<section anchor="triggers"><name>Triggers</name>
<t>Triggers are actions or activities that may cause a SCIM action to occur.  Triggers can occur as a result of business processes like a corporate hiring event, but can also be scheduled events such as a unix bash script running as a chron job, or can be just-in-time events such as SAML assertion arriving at a federated relying party that identifies a not-seen-before user. Triggers can also be standardized events, such as those in the OpenID Shared Signals Framework. Triggers used to allow CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SCIM Actions or Operations as it is designed to capture a class of use case that makes sense to the actor requesting it rather than to describe a protocol operation.</t>

<section anchor="periodic-intervals"><name>Periodic Intervals</name>
<t>A periodic interval trigger is a configured-in-advance agreement where a SCIM client performs an action at a specific time. This trigger is often recurring, and in that case the combination of trigger and action together may be referred to as "polling" the SCIM server. An example of a periodic interval trigger could be a UNIX chron job calling a script.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="events"><name>Events</name>
<t>Event triggers are activities, contexts or notifications that could happen at any time. A SCIM client may be configured to perform a given SCIM action in response to a specific event occuring such as a specific entry written into an audit log, a signal of a corporate workflow completion, or a device management platform notification. A SCIM action could also be triggered by a Security Event Token (SET) as described in <xref target="RFC8417"></xref> or a SCIM event corresponding to [draft-ietf-scim-events]; for example an application acting as a resource subscriber and SCIM client could receive a SCIM event denoting creation of a new user object, triggering a SCIM action to fetch all the attributes for that user.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="application-triggers"><name>Application Triggers</name>
<t>Application triggers occur when administrative or end-user interfaces are manipulated. An example of an application trigger might be a user modifying their profile information, resulting in a SCIM client performing an HTTP POST to update the user's resource object at the SCIM server.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sso-single-sign-on"><name>SSO (Single Sign-on)</name>
<t>Single Sign-on triggers occur when a user authenticates via federated protocols such as SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect. If a federated assertion arrives for a user who has not yet been provisioned into the destination application, the application may be triggered to perform just-in-time (JIT) provisioning. This trigger occurs in scenarios where a Single Sign-On flow happens, but not all the resource attributes for the user object are passed in the federated assertion, resulting in a SCIM action to push or pull remaining needed attributes.</t>

<t>In this model we will have a Client that is going to provide information about a RO and its RA to a Server, this Client is just responsible for a limit set of attributes and do not do any management overall the RO. This SCIM element that is going to manage the RO will then be the Client for other SCIM services that will consume the RO/RA, that might have more RA than the original RO provided by the originator of the RO.</t>

<section anchor="client-active-pull"><name>Client Active Pull</name>
<t>A SCIM client uses the HTTP GET verb to ask for data from a SCIM Server. A client active pull can be used to fetch one object, a subset of objects, or all objects from a SCIM server. In cases where the client is a resource updater, it may perform an active pull of an object or objects in order to determine whether an active push of new data is necessary. Client active pulls can be used in situations where a client needs to maintain a synchronized large body of objects, such as a device list or user address book, but where there isn't any need to track individual RO/RA. 
Another example of a client active pull would be a client that needs to have details of a specific device that was onboarded by a mobile application and that need to provide the RO/RA information on the behalf of the device.</t>

<section anchor="resource-object-creation-or-update"><name>Resource Object Creation or Update</name>
<t>In this model we will have a Client that is going to pull information about a RO/RA from a Server. In this model the Client is going to management all the RO (Resource Objects) and its RA (Resource Attributes), that are provided by the Server, and the RM (Resource Management) function resides on the Client.</t>

<t>In this model we will bring together both of the two previous SCIM actions for pull information, where a typically a device can be the creator or their own attributes and will allow an SaaS service to subscribe to all the different RO/RA and deliver additional services for itself and other devices. It isn't expected from any of the SCIM clients in the Active pull model to create any status database of attributes changes, so the clients will always do a pull on one or many RO (Resource Objects) based on triggers.</t>

<section anchor="scim-use-cases"><name>SCIM Use Cases</name>
<t>This section describes some common SCIM use cases, explaining when, where, why and how we find them in the cross-domain environment. The ultimate goal is guidance for developers working on common models, explaining challenges and components.
Because SCIM is a protocol where two entities exchange information about resources across domains, the use cases explain how the different components can interact to allow from simple to complex architectures for cross domain resource management. Orchestrators roles are mapped to the use cases to simplify the task of explaining the multiple functions of the SCIM elements. Use cases build on each other, starting with simple cases, and ending with the most complex ones.</t>

<section anchor="self-referential-resource-updates-via-me"><name>Self-Referential Resource Updates via /me</name>
<t>Get information about persona /me endpoint.<br />
A use case cover in <xref target="RFC7644"></xref> where a SCIM client can do CRUD operation on the entity of the user, in this use case the SCIM client that is the RM (Resource Manager), RC (Resource Creator) and RU (Resource Updater), will be able to read, create, update the RO (Resource Object) and its RA (Resource Attributes) in the RS (Resource Subscriber). the RS will provide an /me URI to achieve this.<br />
Special considerations exist from authorization perspective; unlike other listed CRUD use cases, the authorization for this use case only allows access to the RO (Resource Object) of the resource owner.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="simple-resource-update"><name>Simple Resource Update</name>
<t>Single RM/RC/RU and multiple RS.<br />
This is a very common and simple SCIM use case, we have the IdM/Device Managers/etc. do all CRUD operation with the resources, then after the trigger mechanisms the resources information RO/RA reach the RS (Resource Subscribers), also know as the SaaS Application.<br />
The RS (Resource Subscriber) will take the decision on which RA (Resource Attributes) to consider and how the RO (Resource Object) will show in its resource database.<br />
Typically we will find this kind of use case in small to mid size organization, where there is no structure method to handle the resources and typically in Organization that start with a blank sheet of paper in a greenfield deployment.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resource-updates-originating-at-a-non-scim-source"><name>Resource Updates Originating at a Non-SCIM Source</name>
<t>One or more ERC with single RM/RC/RU and multiple RS.<br />
This is another common use case, because it allow the organization to adopt SCIM protocol for CRUD operations of their resources. In this use case the organization already have an existent database of resources that is going to be the source of truth for the Resource Manager. <br />
Normally this ERC, specially if we are talking about user Identity, will have a User database that can be accessible using LDAP, some times the ERC can provide RO/RA using SAML Single Sign-On using Just in time Provision. We also see some IDaaS providing softwares that allow them to exchange resource information by using proprietary protocols, very common using HTTP REST to get the information from the ERC to the RM.<br />
Typically in this use case the RM will become the new source of truth for the resources of our Organization, will add extra RA (Resource Attributes) and ignore other RA that existed in the ERC.<br />
Some organization that already realize that going forward in the SCIM path, the RM will manage the RO/RA, will also start create new RO in the RM.<br />
The Resource Subscribers will consume all or a subset of the RO/RA from the RM.<br />
Typically we will see this use case in small to mid size organization where resources were organized in a non standardize platform for Resources Management, where it isn't possible to cut/replace everything with a new system.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resources-from-multiple-scim-sources-coordinated-by-a-resource-manager"><name>Resources from Multiple SCIM Sources Coordinated by a Resource Manager</name>
<t>One or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS.<br />
In this use case, the the CRUD operation for the RO (Resource Object) and its RA (Resource Attributes) does not belong to the RM (Resource Manager), this is done in a separate SCIM entity, the Resource Creator/Resource Updater. <br />
A good example of this is use case are Organization that have their HR application, and the lifecycle of the resource (typically groups and Users) is done by that application.<br />
We could also have devices where the creation and update operations are always done by the device  itself or by a mobile application/web server on their behalf, in this use case the roles of RC/RU moves away from the RM.
We could also have this use case where the RM is extended with the Roles of RC/RU for extra RA (Resources Attributes), but the RO (Resource Object) is typically created by the "HR System"/device. <br />
Typically we will see this use case in mid to large organization where no structure method to handle the resources start with a blank sheet of paper in a  greenfield deployment.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resources-from-scim-and-non-scim-sources-coordinated-by-a-resource-manager"><name>Resources from SCIM and Non-SCIM sources, Coordinated by a Resource Manager</name>
<t>One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS.<br />
In this use case, one source of the Resource information is an ERC (External Resource Creator), or the entity that has the role of RC/RU (such as an HR System). In some cases the HR system can also consume information from the ERC and complement it. 
This doesn't mean that the RM will not need to consolidate RO/RA from the SCIM and non SCIM entities and consolidate and aggregate RO/RAs for those multiple sources. The RM gets its RO (Resource Object) from both systems the RC/RU and from the ERC, and need to define rules which ones to take and to ignore.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="complex-sources-including-multiple-resource-updaters"><name>Complex sources including Multiple Resource Updaters</name>
<t>One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS/RU.<br />
In this use case we add the capability of the Resource Subscriber to be also an Resource Update, it is very common that an SaaS application can be the source of truth for specifics RA and add extra details to the RO.<br />
Typically we will see this use case in large organization where resources were organized in a non standardize platform for Resources Management and it isn't possible to cut/replace everything with a new system. Those organization start to adopt many application that brings new attributes to the different resources that already exist in the system.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="complex-multi-directional-object-and-resource-management-with-simple-resource-subscribers"><name>Complex Multi-directional Object and Resource Management with simple Resource Subscribers</name>
<t>One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU/RS, with single RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS/RU.<br />
In this use case we introduce the possibility of the RC/RU (example given before the HR System) be interested in the attribute that was created updated by the RS/RU (also known as the SaaS application), an example could be adding the business email that was created by the mail service (that came from RS/RU) to the HR information service (the RC/RU/RS element).<br />
Typically we will see this use case in large organization where resources were organized in a non standardize platform for Resources Management and it isn't possible to cut/replace everything with a new system. Those organization start to adopt many application that brings attributes to the different resources that already exist in the system, but they need to have all the important attributes of Resources in a application in our examples "HR application".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="complex-multi-direction-objectresource-management-with-bi-directional-resource-subscriberupdaters"><name>Complex Multi-direction Object/Resource Management with bi-directional Resource Subscriber/Updaters</name>
<t>One or more ERC, one or more RC/RU/RS, with one or more RM/RC/RU/RS and multiple RS/RU.<br />
In this use case we introduce the possibility of having multiple Resource Managers, where the information from the RO/RA is consolidated across different domains/services.<br />
Typically we will see this use case in large organizations, or between organizations that have their own business to business communication and have the need to exchange information about Resources. This example also happens during mergers or acquisitions, where multiple RMs exist and IT departments have to manage each RM in parallel.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>
<t>Authentication and authorization must be guaranteed for the SCIM operations to ensure that only authenticated entities can perform the SCIM requests and the requested SCIM operations are authorized. 
SCIM resources (e.g., Users and Groups) can contain sensitive information.  Thus, data confidentiality MUST be guaranteed at the transport layer.
There can be privacy issues that go beyond transport security, e.g., moving personally identifying information (PII) offshore between different SCIM elements.
Regulatory requirements shall be met when migrating identity information between jurisdictional regions (e.g., countries and states may have differing regulations on privacy).
Additionally, privacy-sensitive data elements may be omitted or obscured in SCIM transactions or stored records to protect these data elements for a user. For instance, a role-based identifier might be used in place of an individual's name.
Detailed security considerations are specified in Section 7 of the SCIM protocol <xref target="RFC7644"></xref> and Section 9 of the SCIM schema <xref target="RFC7643"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications and services easier. The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP.</t>

      <t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is an HTTP-based protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios easier to support via a standardized service. Examples include, but are not limited to, enterprise-to-cloud service providers and inter-cloud scenarios. The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema, an extension model, and a service protocol defined by this document.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure. A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject. These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject. This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events. A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.</t>
